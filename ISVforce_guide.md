# ISVforce Guide

- Guide to **plan, build, distribute, market, sell, and support** solutions that run on the Salesforce platform.

## Solution Lifecycle

### Application Architect

- Determines the **scope** of the solution and the internal structures that support it. 
- Architects need details about the underlying Lightning Platform platform that determine not only the solution's use, but which editions it supports, how it's installed, configured, and upgraded

### A developer creates, packages, and uploads a solution

- A developer, or often a team of developers, creates a solution, packages it, and uploads it to AppExchange. 
- Developers also update the solution with bug fixes and new features.

### A publisher distributes, sells, and supports the solution

- The publisher of a solution is the person or company who has a **profile and one or more listings** for the solution on AppExchange
- Publisher listings contain a link to a solution they uploaded to AppExchange or to a third-party website. 
- Publishers also set default license settings. 

### An administrator installs the solution

- An administrator, or admin, downloads your solution from AppExchange and installs it into their organization. 
- Admins can also customize the solution to further suit their business needs.
