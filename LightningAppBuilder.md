# Lightning App Builder

- The Lightning App Builder is a point-and-click tool that makes it easy to create custom pages for the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience, giving your users what they need all in one place.
- When you edit a Lightning app from the **App Manager in Setup**, you’re brought into the Lightning App Builder to manage the app’s settings.

- You can update the app’s branding, navigation, options, and manage the Lightning pages assigned to that app all in the Lightning App Builder.

#### Example Lightning Page

With the Lightning App Builder, you can build:

- **Single-page apps** that drill down into standard pages.
- **Dashboard-style apps**, such as apps to track top sales prospects or key leads for the quarter
- **Point apps** to solve a particular task, such as an expense app for users to enter expenses and monitor expenses they’ve submitted
- **Custom record pages** for your objects, tailored to the needs of your users
- **Custom Home pages** containing the components and features that your users use most

#### Lightning Page Templates

The structure of a Lightning page adapts for the device it’s viewed on. The template you choose when creating the page controls how it displays on a given device. The Lightning page’s template divides the page into regions.

#### Lightning Page Types 

- **App Page:** Create a home page for a third-party app that you can add directly into the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience navigation menus.
- **Home Page:** Create Home pages with features **relevant to specific types of users**, and assign the customized pages to different apps or app-and-user-profile combinations.
- **Record Page:** You can create a customized version of an **object’s record page**, tailoring it to your users’ needs.
